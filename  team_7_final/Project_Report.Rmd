## Do Children Copy an Expert or a Majority? Examining Selective Learning in Instrumental and Normative Contexts


This study examined whether instrumental and normative learning contexts differentially influence 4- to 7-year-old childrenâ€™s social learning strategies; specifically, their dispositions to copy an expert versus a majority consensus

## Experiment 1 :

In Experiment 1, they have tested whether 4-to-7-year-olds selectively copy an instrumentally competent expert over an incompetent individual.They included 4-to-7-year-old children to examine whether there is a developmental progression in the degree of copying faithfully and whether there are differences in development according to context.


### Converting and Reading Dataset1 :


```{r}
# convert .SAV file to .csv file
data_source <- "/Users/meghanainamanamelluri/Desktop/Final Project/DataSets/S1_Dataset.SAV"
convert(data_source,"/Users/meghanainamanamelluri/Desktop/Maths/DataSets/S1_Dataset.csv")
```



```{r read_data_from_csv,}
#reading the csv file
data_source <- "/Users/meghanainamanamelluri/Desktop/Maths/DataSets/S1_Dataset.csv"
s1_data <- read_csv(data_source)
glimpse(s1_data)
```
